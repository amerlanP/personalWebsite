This is a mobile app that uses data from The Brewery Collectibles Club of America (BCCA - https://bcca.com/) to create an elegant and intuitive way for browing the vast respository of beer cans.

Utilizing the Flutter framework, I created a responsive and modern-looking UI that far exceeds the practicality of the archaic, browser based search engine available on the BCCA website. Every preview tile can be horizonally scrolled, showing each side of the can. Users can search or scroll through over 10,000 beer can previews and tap on any one they like. Then, a new screen will appear, enlarging the picture of the can and showing extensive details about that specific can. Tapping on the image once more will make it full screen, allowing for pinch zooming and rotation. This app also allows users to search based on different criteria made available in the filter search screen.
